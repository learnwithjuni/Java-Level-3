    // Map-1: What is a map? 

    // Map-2: Henry wants to create a map that pairs his friend’s names with their ages. Combine the two parallel lists into a map!

    String[] names = {"Joe", "Phil", "Cheyenne", "Josh", "Ryan", "Samantha", "Nate", "Addie", "Nichole", "Raegan", "Caroline"};
    int[] ages = {22, 23, 21, 18, 18, 25, 24, 22, 21, 20, 19};

    // Map-3,4: Iterate through the map and print out each name and age on a separate line. 

    // Map-5: Check if Henry’s friend “Kyle” is in the map. If he is, print “Kyle is in the map!”. If he’s not, add him to the map. Kyle is 22 years old. 

    // Map-6: Henry has a second friend named Joe, but he’s 21 years old. Add this second Joe to the map. 
    //Map-6: Now that you’ve added the second Joe, print the map. What do you notice? Why is this the case?

    // Map-7: Can you think of some situations when maps may be useful?
