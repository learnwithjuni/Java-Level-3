    // LinkedList-1: What is a singly-linked list? Compared to an ArrayList, what advantages and disadvantages does it have?

    // LinkedList-2: Without looking at any previous code, complete the Node inner class that has been provided in the starter code. When you’re finished, compare it to what you wrote previously.

    // LinkedList-3: Let's extend our LinkedList class. Write an indexOf() method that takes in an item and returns the index of the item in the list. Return -1 if the item doesn't exist in the list. 

    //LinkedList-3: Create a LinkedList that contains at least 5 different strings. Test your method by looking up strings that do and don't exist in the list!

    // LinkedList-4: What is a doubly linked list? Compared to a singly linked-list, what advantages and disadvantages does it have?

    // LinkedList-5: Modify the Node inner class so that it could be used in a doubly linked list. When you’re finished, compare it to what you wrote previously. 
    
    // LinkedList-6: Let's extend our DoublyLinkedList class. Write a remove() method that takes in an item and removes it from the doubly-linked list. Return true if an item is removed, and false if the item isn't in the list. 

    // LinkedList-6: Create a DoublyLinkedList of integers from 0-10. Test your method by printing the list and the length of the list before and after the deletion.
